# Mine

Simple Unity rock mining game for GearVR or PC, similar to Boulderdash, Chips Challege, Crystal Mines, etc. This is the first thing I made with Unity before I knew what I was doing so it is not very well organized and was ported to C# from from some DirectX code I created a really long time ago. It has lots of features but is kind of slow and jittery and I would probably do it differently now. It has lots of features including pipes, sand, crystals, etc. Some things did not comvert well during the Unity 3->4->5 process.
